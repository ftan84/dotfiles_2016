# Dotfiles
A set of environment setting dotfiles that are tuned to my personal preference

## Requirements
The install script should install everything needed for the environment to run properly.
The only setup you need to make is to install [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) so that Vim
airline will render the glyphs properly

## Installation
Change into the dotfiles directory and run the install.sh script.

```
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
